    "# Feature Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**RankEval** provides feature analysis tools that allow to estimate the **feature importance** of a trained tree-based ensemble. This analysis can be used for feature selection to improve the estimators’ efficiency on very high-dimensional datasets. The general premise is that features can be either irrelevant or redundant, and thus they can be removed from the dataset without incurring in much loss of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "A benefit of using gradient boosting algorithms consisting of a number of binary decision trees is that it is relatively straightforward to compute feature importance scores at training time. Indeed, each decision tree is described by multiple nodes, either split or leaf nodes. Every split node is a condition on a single feature, and it is designed to split the dataset into two so that similar response values end up in the same set. Computing feature importance is thus as simple as to sum for each decision tree the amount that each split node (i.e., the feature used by the split node) improves a given performance measure. The performance measure most commonly adopted is the Gini index (purity) used to select the next split nodes at training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "RankEval implement the calculation of feature importance by *simulating* the traditional training behaviour at scoring time, i.e., with the model already fully trained. To this regard RankEval allows to compute feature importance independently of the framework used to train the model, providing insightful also for frameworks that do not support feature analysis. Moreover, the calculation of feature importance is parametric in the performance measure, allowing for fine-grained and personalized analysis."

    "\n",
    "The `feature_importance` analysis is executed on a single dataset and model, using a given metric for computing the performance gain at each split node. By default the analysis uses MSE as performance measure (and only in this case the analysis is very efficient since it is realized using low-level cython code). The function returns a xarray.DataArray with the value of `feature_importance` and `feature_count` (the former summing performance gain related to a given feature, the latter counting the number of times a feature is used in a split node) for each feature."

Moreover, it is possible to pass a list of feature names to use in place on feature index in the plot."
